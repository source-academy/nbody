# Multiverse

You can setup multiple universes in a single simulation. This is useful for simulating multiple n-body systems in parallel with varying initial configurations, forces, simuation functions and/or transformations. Simply create each universe as you would for a single universe simulation and pass them as an array to the **Simulation** object in the following way. Available for both 2D and 3D visualizations, UI controls (when enabled) are provided to hide/show each universe separately (see [Controller](?path=/docs/visualize-controller--docs)).

## Single Universe - 2D

```js
new Simulation(universe);
new Simulation([universe]);
```

<center>
  <Story of={MultiverseStories.SingleUniverse} name="SingleUniverse" />
</center>

## Multiverse - 2D

```js
new Simulation([universe1, universe2], {});
```

<center>
  <Story of={MultiverseStories.Multiverse} name="Multiverse" />
</center>

## Multiverse - 3D

```js
new Simulation([universe1, universe2], {
  visType: "3D",
  controller: 'ui',
});
```

<center>
  <Story of={MultiverseStories.Multiverse3D} name="Multiverse3D" />
