# Trails

Trails are the paths that objects take as they move through space. They can be shown or hidden using the `showTrails` field when creating a **Simulation** object in the following way. Once simulation is running, trails can be toggled on or off using the UI controls or through code, when controller is set to `ui` or `code` respectively. Maximum trail length can also be set using the `maxTrailLength` field, and this is the maximum number of points that will be tracked for all objects combined. Available in both 2D and 3D views.

```js
new Simulation(universe, {
    showTrails: true | false,
    maxTrailLength: number,
})
```

## Off (default)

When set to false, trails are not shown.

```js
new Simulation(universe, {
    showTrails: false
})
```

<center><Story of={TrailsStories.ShowTrailsOff} name="ShowTrailsOff" /></center>

## On

When set to true, trails are shown.

```js
new Simulation(universe, {
    showTrails: true
})
```


<center><Story of={TrailsStories.ShowTrailsOn} name="ShowTrailsOn" /></center>
