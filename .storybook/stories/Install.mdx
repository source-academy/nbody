# Installation

## Via npm registry
nbody is available on the npm registry as [nbody](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nbody). Simply follow the following install commands based on your package manager. Since nbody relies on [three](https://threejs.org/) and [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for visualization of the simulations, they have to be installed alongside nbody.

If you are using Typescript, you may also have to install type definitions as well.


```bash
npm install nbody three plotly.js-dist
npm install --save-dev @types/three @types/plotly.js
```
or 

```bash
yarn add nbody three plotly.js-dist
yarn add -D @types/three @types/plotly.js
```

## Via CDN

> **WARNING**: Using nbody via the CDN may not work as intended as peer dependencies of three and plotly.js would not be accessible to nbody during runtime. A bundled version is in the roadmap for future development - consider [contributing](?path=/docs/getting-started-contribute--docs).

nbody is available via the unpkg CDN as follows.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/nbody"></script>
```
