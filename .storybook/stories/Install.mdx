# Installation guide
nbody is available on the npm registry as [nbody](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nbody). Simply follow the following install commands based on your package manager. Since nbody relies on [three](https://threejs.org/) and [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for visualization of the simulations, they have to be installed alongside nbody.

If you are using Typescript, you may also have to install type definitions as well.


```bash
npm install nbody three plotly.js-dist
npm install --save-dev @types/three @types/plotly.js
```
or 

```bash
yarn add nbody three plotly.js-dist
yarn add -D @types/three @types/plotly.js
```
