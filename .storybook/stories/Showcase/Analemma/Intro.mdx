# Analemma

An analemma is a curve representing the changing position of the Sun in the sky, as viewed from a fixed location on the Earth at the same clock time over the course of an year. Analemma shapes range from figure-8s to infinity symbols, depending on the observer's latitude and the time of day. The analemma is a result of the Earth's tilt and elliptical orbit around the Sun. Analemmas can also be seen on other planets, with shapes that are different from Earth's due to different axial tilts and orbital eccentricities. The analemma on Mars, for example, is a teardrop shape. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma)]

Analemmas are a good example of what is possible with *nbody*, as they involve the simulation of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, along with frame of reference transformations.
