# Sun-Earth Analemma

Analemma as seen from the Earth on the equator mid-day. Frame of reference transformations have been setup to replicate the axial tilt of the earth. Additionally, the frame is rotated smoothly (as opposed to every 24 hours) to smooth out the analemma curve. Use the controls below to change the axial tilt of the Earth and its effects on the shape of the analemma.
