# Horseshoe Orbits

Horseshoe orbits are a type of co-orbital motion of a small body around a larger body. The orbital period of the smaller body is very close to that of the larger body, and the two bodies are in a 1:1 orbital resonance. The smaller body appears to move in a horseshoe shape relative to the larger body as seen from a non-rotating frame of reference. Read on to find out more about and see horse shoe orbits in action.
