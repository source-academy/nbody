# Simulate

The Solar system has been setup based on positions and velocities of the planets on 1st January 2024. You can simulate the system at a high speed to oberve the traced orbits. However, keep in mind that the faster you simulate, the less accurate the orbits will be (due to the numerical integration method used).
