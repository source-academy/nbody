# nbody

A JS/TS library to configure, simulate and visualize nbody simulations in the browser.

# Background

The [**n-body problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem), a cornerstone of celestial mechanics, involves predicting the motions of multiple objects interacting **gravitationally**. While solvable analytically for [two-bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem), we rely on computer simulations using numerical integration methods for three or more.

This project aims to bridge the _space_ between accuracy, accessibility, performance and education. With this JS/TS library, you can

- **Effortlessly configure** your system of bodies.
- **Simulate with flexibility** utilizing various accurate and/or performant numerical integration methods or even write you own.
- **Visually explore** and immerse yourself with customizable 2D and 3D visualizations and intuitive UI controls

# Development

**nbody** is maintained by the open-source [Source Academy](https://github.com/source-academy/) development community based in National University of Singapore. Anyone from anywhere is free to contribute to the project and the community.
