# nbody

Frontend library to **configure**, **simulate** and **visualize** nbody simulations, entirely on the client-side browser.

# Background

The [**n-body problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem), a cornerstone of celestial mechanics, involves predicting the motions of multiple objects interacting **gravitationally**. While solvable analytically for [two-bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem), we rely on computer simulations using numerical integration methods for three or more.

This library aims to bridge the _space_ between accuracy, accessibility, performance and education. With *nbody*, you can

- **Effortlessly configure** your system of bodies.
- **Simulate with flexibility** utilizing various accurate and/or performant numerical integration methods or even write you own.
- **Visually explore** and immerse yourself with customizable 2D and 3D visualizations and intuitive UI controls

# Development

**nbody** started off as the author's final year project (FYP) in AY23/24 at the National University of Singapore, under the insightful guidance of [Prof. Martin Henz](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/). The project is set for a public beta release by the end of the FYP duration.

**nbody** is maintained by the open-source [Source Academy](https://github.com/source-academy/) development community based in National University of Singapore. Anyone from anywhere is free and welcome to contribute to our project and our community.

## Thank you

Eternally grateful to [Prof. Martin Henz](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/) for kick starting the project, as well as the invaluable guidance and support throughout the project. This project would also not have existed without the inspiration and achievements of

- [Martin Vezina](https://medium.com/@m_vezina) and his [jsOrrery](https://mgvez.github.io/jsorrery/)
- [Ian Webster](https://github.com/typpo) and his [spacekit](https://typpo.github.io/spacekit/docs/index.html)
