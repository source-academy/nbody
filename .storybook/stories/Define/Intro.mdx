# Define

The library provides a set of predefined building blocks (force, simulate function, transformation) that can be used to define a simulation. However, the library is designed to be extensible and allows users to define their own building blocks in either JavaScript or TypeScript. Check out each building block's page for more details.

- [Simulate Function](?path=/docs/define-simulate-function--docs)
- [Transformation](?path=/docs/define-transformation--docs)
