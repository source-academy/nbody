## Creating vectors

A `Vector3` is a 3D vector with `x`, `y`, and `z` components. It is used to represent kinematic properties such as _position_, _velocity_, and _acceleration_.

Create a vector object using the `Vector3` class. Inherited from **three.js** Vector3, full documentation can be found [here](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Vector3).

```javascript
let testVector = new Vector3(1, 2, 3);
```

## Creating bodies

A `CelestialBody` is a celestial object with a _mass_ and kinematic properties such as _position_, _velocity_, and _acceleration_. It also has a unique _label_ for identification purposes.

Create celestial bodies using the `CelestialBody` class. Full API reference can be found [here](https://source-academy.github.io/nbody/api/classes/CelestialBody.html).

```javascript
let body1 = new CelestialBody(
  "Body 1", // label
  1, // mass
  new Vector3(-0.97000436, 0.24308753, 0), // position
  new Vector3(0.466203685, 0.43236573, 0), // velocity
  new Vector3(0, 0, 0) // acceleration
);

let body2 = new CelestialBody(
  "Body 2",
  1,
  new Vector3(0.97000436, -0.24308753, 0),
  new Vector3(0.466203685, 0.43236573, 0),
  new Vector3(0, 0, 0)
);

let body3 = new CelestialBody(
  "Body 3",
  1,
  new Vector3(0, 0, 0),
  new Vector3(-2 * 0.466203685, -2 * 0.43236573, 0),
  new Vector3(0, 0, 0)
);
```

## Define a force

A force object encapsulates logic for calculating forces acting on celestial bodies due to other objects or environment.

Create a force object using the `Force` interface or use one of the predefined forces. Full API reference can be found [here](https://source-academy.github.io/nbody/api/interfaces/Force.html).

```javascript
// define a gravitational force with a strength of 1
const customForce = new Gravity(1);
```

## Define a simulate function

A simulate function object encapsulates logic for advancing the state of the universe over time using numerical integration.

Create a simulate function (or [numerical integrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration)) object using the `SimulateFunction` interface or use one of the predefined simulate functions. Full API reference can be found [here](https://source-academy.github.io/nbody/api/interfaces/SimulateFunction.html).

```javascript
// define an explicit Euler integrator with the custom force
const customSimFunc = new ExplicitEulerSim(customForce);
```

## Creating a state

A State is a snapshot of the universe at a given time. It contains an array of celestial bodies.

Create a state object using the `State` class. Full API reference can be found [here](https://source-academy.github.io/nbody/api/classes/State.html).

```javascript
// create a State object with the array of celestial bodies
let customState = new State([body1, body2]);
```

## Creating an universe

A Universe is a container for the current state and previous states of the universe and the simulation function. It also has a unique label for identification purposes.

Create a universe object using the `Universe` class. Full API reference can be found [here](https://source-academy.github.io/nbody/api/classes/Universe.html).

```javascript
let universe = new Universe({
  label: "Universe 1",
  currState: customState,
  simFunc: customSimFunc,
});
```

## Put it all together

A Simulation object controls the universe(s), simulation loop and rendering of the simulation.

Create a simulation object using the `Simulation` class. Full API reference can be found [here](https://source-academy.github.io/nbody/api/classes/Simulation.html).

```javascript
let simulation = new Simulation(universe, {});
simulation.start(<div-id>, 800, 800);
```

You've done it! You just simulated a special configuration of the [three-body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) system using the _nbody_ library. Feel free to experiment with different configurations to see how systems evolve over time with various forces, integrators and transformations (read on to find out what those are).
